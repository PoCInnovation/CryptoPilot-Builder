# MCP API Server

## Download requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Agno version with tools

To run the Agno version with tools, you can use the following command :

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

## MCP version

To run the MCP version, you can use the following command:

```bash
python mcp_api_server.py
```

## Main differences

For now, the MCP version does not have any of the tools that the Agno version has.
It cannot get the price of a crypto, cannot initiate any transaction, etc.

But, this implementation is more flexible and faster.
